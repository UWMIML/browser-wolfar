# Browser-based Wolf AR
Testing AR on GLTF loaded wolf asset

Demo at https://uwmiml.github.io/browser-wolfar

If the model doesn't load when locally testing, copy the rigged-wolf.bin
file to the .serve directory as it is not auto-generated in there since
it is not referenced in the code for the module builder to produce.

Install dependencies called from HTML file with:
```
npm install
```
